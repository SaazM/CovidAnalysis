# CovidAnalysis
In realCorona I got data from WHO and worldbank. I converted them to dataframes. I had to make some changes to the name certain areas so I could effectivley merge them together. I only used countries that had over 20,000 cases. I added a ratio column, after that I did a inner merge and calculated the pearson r.
In countyCorona I got data from NY times and the cencus government. I followed a similar process with realCorona and claculates the pearson r.
